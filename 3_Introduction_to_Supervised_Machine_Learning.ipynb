So, first, we will provide the training to the machine to understand the images, such as the shape & size of the tail of cat and dog, Shape of eyes, colour, height (dogs are taller, cats are smaller), etc. After completion of training, we input the picture of a cat and ask the machine to identify the object and predict the output. Now, the machine is well trained, so it will check all the features of the object, such as height, shape, colour, eyes, ears, tail, etc., and find that it's a cat. So, it will put it in the Cat category. This is the process of how the machine identifies the objects in Supervised Learning."

Learning means that the model will build some logic of its own.\n",
